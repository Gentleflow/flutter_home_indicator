## 1.1.0

* Add `deferScreenEdges`. A "deferred" screen edge is one the user needs to swipe in from _twice_ to trigger the OS behavior. (Deferring the bottom screen edge corresponds to "greying out" the home indicator, hence its inclusion in this package.)

## 1.0.3

* Use proper Swift 4 syntax for overriding property.

## 1.0.2

* iOS: only override `prefersHomeIndicatorAutoHidden` if it is available.

## 1.0.1

* Update repository URL.

## 1.0.0

* Initial release: `show`, `hide`, and `isHidden` functions.
